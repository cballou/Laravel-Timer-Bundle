## Timer Bundle

The Laravel Timer bundle can be used as a drop-in alternative to utilizing the built-in
profiler for determining execution time of segments of your code. It's like a
stopwatch. It does not utilize callback functions as does Profiler, so there are
a few benefits and drawbacks:

#### Benefits ####

You can make calls to the Timer from anywhere in your code. It doesn't require
refactoring to use a bunch of callbacks if you have an existing codebase (as is
the case with Profiler).

Also, by not using callbacks, you're saving yourself on extra uneccessary function
calls to call_user_func_array() and the like, likely improving application performance.

#### Drawbacks ####

The timer will be less accurate than the built in Profiler timer as Timer has a
bit more scaffolding. With that being said, one could argue that the flexibility of
not having to use callback functions is a huge benefit.

## Installing using Artisan CLI:

```bash
php artisan bundle:install timer
```

Either auto-load the bundle in application/bundles.php:

```php
return array(
    'timer' => array('auto' => true)
);
```

Or manually start:

```php
Bundle::start('timer');
```

## Usage/Examples

#### Creating a timer

```php
Timer::start('name-of-timer');

// perform a task

Timer::stop('name-of-timer');
```

#### Creating multiple timers
You can create as many unique timers as you'd like.

```php
Timer::start('first-timer');
Timer::start('second-timer');
```

#### Adding checkpoints to an existing timer

Checkpoints can be created for an existing timer which will calculate the time from start as well as the time since last checkpoint.
If you are familiar with the built in profiler and ticks, checkpoints are essentially the same thing. They are useful if you wish to
use a single timer throughout your application and add in your own breakpoints.

```php
Timer::start('my-timer-name');

// do some work
sleep(2);

// create a checkpoint
Timer::checkpoint('my-timer-name', 'The first checkpoint after sleeping 2 seconds.');

// do some more work
sleep(1);

// another checkpoint
Timer::checkpoint('my-timer-name', 'A second checkpoint which will also calculate time elapsed from first checkpoint.');

// some other stuff
sleep(3);

// end the timer and use return values as you please
$values = Timer::stop('my-timer-name');
```

#### Retrieving timer results
While you can retrieve a single timer's results as an array by calling `Timer::stop()`,
you can also retrieve the full set of all timer results as a multi-dimensional array
by calling `Timer::dump()`. If you have any currently running timers that you failed
to stop, `Timer::dump()` makes sure to handle stopping them.

`Timer::dump()` also takes a single boolean parameter, `$toFile`, which will create
a timestamped log file in `storage/logs/timer_YYYY-MM-DD_HHiiSS.log`. This is
helpful if you don't want to manually deal with your existing timers and prefer to
analyze the results at a later date. The other benefit of storing timer results in
a log file is that Timer will pretty print your results as JSON for easier readability.

```php
Timer::start('my-timer');

// some work
sleep(1);

// create a second timer for the hell of it
Timer::start('second-timer');

// create a checkpoint on the first timer
Timer::checkpoint('my-timer', 'A checkpoint for no good reason.');

// some more work
sleep(2);

// choose one of the following two (with the second exporting results to log file)
Timer::dump();
Timer::dump(true);
```

#### Resetting all timers
Timer has a built in method to clear out (reset) all pre-existing timers so you
can start fresh. Likewise, simply re-using a timer name in `Timer::start()`
will also clear out and re-initialize a single timer.

```php
// start a timer
Timer::start('my-timer');

// clear all existing timers
Timer::clear();

// we can reuse the existing timer
Timer::start('my-timer');
```
